Technical guide

This is an technical documentation for the Vaadin form project.

Vaadin framework was the chosen framework for this project because of
author's interest in this technology and it's well suited for creating
a web UI. In this case the user interface was a form for a job applicant.

The form has four fealds for first name, last name, gender and a larger text area
for the reasons to apply for a job. When user has filled the information and tries
to send them, the application verifies that the name fields are not empty. If they
are empty, an error message is given. Also, the user cannot send too much text, as
the maximum number of characters are defined for each text field.

When the form is sent, the application saves the information to a JavaBean object. Each property of the object is bind to a form field.

The data is then stored in a PostgreSQL database. If storing the data was successful,
a resulst page is rendered for the user, where the entered information is displayed
once again. In case something goes wrong with the database, an error message is 
displayed.

For building this project, Apache Maven 3.1.0 was used.

Java versions:
Java 1.7
JavaEE 5

Vaadin 7.15 was the chosen version for this project. Actually, the project
was started using Vaadin 6.8.3 but later the author made the decicion to
upgrade to Vaadin 7.1.5. The reason for the upgrade was to experiment also with
Vaadin 7 that is not backwards compatible with previous Vaadin versions. A working
prototype of this project using Vaadin 6.8.3 can be found in Git commit 6112be2a95.

For the database, PostgreSQL 9.3 was chosen. The decicion to use an external
database was made by the author who wanted to experiment setting up an 
PostgreSQL-database and using it.

NetBeans 7.3.1 was used as an IDE for this project.

The application was developed and tested on Apache Tomcat 7.0.34.0 server and
Google Chrome 29.0.1547.66 m web browser.
